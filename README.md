Visualise a Git repository's commit history in PDF form via the command-line

![ezgif-pdf-tutorial](https://github.com/tomasvana10/commits2pdf/assets/124552709/fcc4b5da-2326-4405-80fe-cf984f61129c)

## Dependencies
`GitPython` `fpdf` `progressbar` `pathvalidate`

`pycairo` (used for deprecated PDF generation method, must be installed manually)

## Installation
**requires [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)**

If using `python` or `pip` doesn't work, try using `python3` or `pip3`

- Make a virtual environment and activate it (recommended):
```
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
MacOS/Unix: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv\scripts\activate
```
- Install the package in your system directory/virtual environment:
```
pip install -U commits2pdf
```
or, install the package in your home directory if you aren't using a virtual environment:
```
pip install --user -U commits2pdf
```
- You can deactivate your virtual environment when you are done:
```
deactivate
```

## Usage
First, it is recommended that you change your terminal's directory to the path of your Git repository's folder:
- First, find your repository's folder, then:
- On Windows/Linux: Open the folder, press `CTRL+L`, then press `CTRL+C`
- On MacOS: Right click on the folder, hold `option` (`‚å•`) and click `Copy <folder name> as Pathname`

Then, in your terminal, type `cd <the path you copied>` (paste in the path with `CTRL+V` or `CMD+V`). Now, you are ready to use commits2pdf!

<br>**Usage example #1**
```
c2p tomasvana10
```
> Output a PDF to your current directory (assuming it is a git repository that is owned by `tomasvana10`).

<br>**Usage example #2**
```
c2p tomasvana10 -o .. -rp ./my_repo -n "new_name.pdf"
```
> Output a PDF (overriding its name to `new_name`) to the parent directory, selecting `./my_repo` as your git repository to access the commits from.

<br>**Usage example #3**
```
c2p tomasvana10 -nc 10 -in "javascript,build" -ex "testing"
```
> Output a PDF to the current directory, displaying the newest 10 commits after filtering commits that contain "javascript" and/or "build in their title or description and do not contain "testing".

<br>**Usage example #4**
```
c2p devguarv -fc Yr-12-HSC-SDD-Task-2 -e 28/4/2024
```
> Clone the repo `Yr-12-HSC-SDD-Task-2` into the current directory and output a PDF into the same place after filtering commits that were made up to `28/4/2024`.

## PDF generation implementations
### pycairo (gen1 - deprecated)
üëç Fast<br>
üëé Cannot write multipage commits<br>
üëé Looks like crap<br>
üëé No hyperlinks, therefore the entire link to a commit's diff is displayed

### fpdf (gen2a)
üëç Fast<br>
üëç Can be scaled with the `-sc <float>` argument<br> 
üëç Sleek design<br>
üëç Information title page<br>
üëç Contains hyperlinks<br>
üëç Stores PDF metadata<br>
üëé Inconsistent page breaks, a general limitation with FPDF when trying to fit as many whole commits on a single page<br> 

### fpdf (gen2b - Default)
üëç Same as `gen2a` but with accurate page breaking<br>
üëé Slow when generating large amounts of commits (generally, it is a good idea to enable `-gen2a` when drawing over 5000 commits)<br>
