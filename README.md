`progressbar`
<br><br>
## Installation
**Requires [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)**

Make a virtual environment (recommended)
```
pip install virtualenv OR pip3 install virtualenv

## Usage
**Usage example #1**
```
c2p tomasvana10

<br>**Usage example #2**
```
c2p tomasvana10 -o .. -rp ./my_repo
```
> Output a PDF to the parent directory, selecting `./my_repo` as your git repository to access the commits from.

<br>**Usage example #3**
```
c2p tomasvana10 -nnc 10 -in "javascript,build" -ex "testing"
```
> Output a PDF to the current directory, displaying the newest 10 commits after filtering commits that contain "javascript" or "build in their title or description and do not contain "testing"

## PDF Generation implementations
### pycairo (gen1)
üëç Fast<br>
üëé Cannot write multipage commits<br>
üëé Looks like crap<br>
üëé No hyperlinks, therefore the entire link to a commit's diff is displayed

### fpdf (gen2a)
üëç Fast<br>
üëç Can be scaled with the `-sc <float>` argument<br> 
üëç Sleek design<br>
üëç Information title page<br>
üëç Contains hyperlinks<br>
üëç Stores PDF metadata<br>
üëé Inconsistent page breaks, a general limitation with FPDF when trying to fit as many whole commits on a single page<br> 

### fpdf (gen2b - Default)
üëç Same as gen2a but with perfectly accurate page breaking<br>
üëé Slow when generating large amounts of commits (generally, it is a good idea to switch to gen2a (with the `-gen2a` argument) when drawing over 5000 commits)<br>
