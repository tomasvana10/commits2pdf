Visualise a Git repository's commit history in PDF form via the command-line

![ezgif-pdf-tutorial](https://github.com/tomasvana10/commits2pdf/assets/124552709/fcc4b5da-2326-4405-80fe-cf984f61129c)

## Dependencies
`GitPython` `fpdf` `progressbar` `pathvalidate`

`pycairo` (used for deprecated PDF generation method, must be installed manually)

## Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing `commits2pdf` requires Python and pip.
> If you have Python installed without pip, click **[here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)** to install it.<br><br>
> If you do not have Python installed, download the installer **[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**, then refer to the previous link on how to install pip.<br><br>
> Additionaly, `commits2pdf` requires Git for `gitpython` functionality. Install it **[here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)**.

> [!TIP]
> If using `python` or `pip` doesn't work, try using `python3` or `pip3`.

- Make a virtual environment and activate it (recommended):

  - Before you make a virtual environment, you should change your current directory to the folder of your repository. If you don't know how, read [Changing your terminal's directory](#changing-your-terminals-directory).
```
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
MacOS/Unix: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv\scripts\activate
```
- Install the package in your system directory/virtual environment:
```
pip install -U commits2pdf
```
or, install the package in your home directory if you aren't using a virtual environment:
```
pip install --user -U commits2pdf
```
- You can deactivate your virtual environment when you are done:
```
deactivate
```

> [!TIP]
> **If you encounter errors with building `pycairo`, click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76175684/23245953)**

## Changing your terminal's directory
1. Open your terminal
2. Find your repository's folder
3. (a) On Windows/Linux: Open the folder, press `CTRL+L`, then press `CTRL+C`. Alternatively, right click on the folder and click `Copy as path`.
3. (b) On MacOS: Right click on the folder, hold `option` (`‚å•`) and click `Copy <folder name> as Pathname`

Then, in your terminal, run `cd <the path you copied>` (paste in the path with `CTRL+V` or `CMD+V`).

## Command-line parameters
There are many ways to configure the process of PDF generation through command line flags. For a brief introduction on how to use these flags, read [Usage](#usage)

## Usage

> [!TIP]
> If the value you are providing for a given argument/flag includes spaces, wrap in it quotations ("") to ensure it is parsed properly.

**Usage example #1**
```
c2p tomasvana10
```
> Output a PDF to your current directory (assuming it is a git repository that is owned by `tomasvana10`).

<br>**Usage example #2**
```
c2p tomasvana10 -o .. -rp ./my_repo -n "new_name.pdf"
```
> Output a PDF (overriding its name to `new_name`) to the parent directory, selecting `./my_repo` as your git repository to access the commits from.

<br>**Usage example #3**
```
c2p tomasvana10 -nc 10 -in "javascript,build" -ex "testing"
```
> Output a PDF to the current directory, displaying the newest 10 commits after filtering commits that contain "javascript" and/or "build" in their title or description and do not contain "testing".

<br>**Usage example #4**
```
c2p devguarv -fc Yr-12-HSC-SDD-Task-2 -e 28/4/2024
```
> Clone the repo `Yr-12-HSC-SDD-Task-2` into the current directory and output a PDF into the same place after filtering commits that were made up to `28/4/2024`.

## PDF generation implementations
### pycairo (gen1 - deprecated)
üëç Fast

üëé Cannot write multipage commits

üëé Looks like crap

üëé No hyperlinks, therefore the entire link to a commit's diff is displayed

### fpdf (gen2a)
üëç Fast

üëç Can be scaled with the `-sc <float>` argument<

üëç Sleek design

üëç Information title page

üëç Contains hyperlinks

üëç Stores PDF metadata

üëé Inconsistent page breaks, a general limitation with FPDF when trying to fit as many whole commits on a single page

### fpdf (gen2b - Default)
üëç Same as `gen2a` but with accurate page breaking

üëé Slow when generating large amounts of commits (generally, it is a good idea to enable `-gen2a` when drawing over 5000 commits)
